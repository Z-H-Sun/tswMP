# If the program fails to automatically find the handle of the window or process/thread ID of TSW, uncomment the following lines and manually assign them here:
# $hWnd = 0x0
# $pID = 0
# $tID = 0

# The following lines modifies the hotkey to be Alt+F2
MODIFIER = 1
KEY = 113
# Other examples:
# MODIFIER = 6; KEY = 90 # Ctrl+Shift+Z
# MODIFIER = 0; KEY = 9 # Tab. This is dangerous and deprecated
# And so on.
# Cheat sheet: 0=None, 1=Alt, 2=Ctrl, 4=Shift, 8=Win.
# Virtual key codes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes. A-Z is just their ASCII (65-90). F1-F12 is 112-123.

# To successfully quit the program by holding the hotkey, you should make sure your keyboard repeat delay is longer than INTERVAL_REHOOK AND keyboard repeat rate is shorter than INTERVAL_QUIT. The default setting is good as long as you have not made changes to your system settings; otherwise, you should make changes accordingly to the following two lines
# Note that INTERVAL_REHOOK should not be too small (typically >150 ms), because you need to quickly press the hotkey twice within INTERVAL_REHOOK to trigger the "rehook" function
INTERVAL_REHOOK = 400
INTERVAL_QUIT = 60

# The following line turns off auto-refresh of TSW status
$autoRefresh = false
