# If the program fails to automatically find the handle of the window or process ID of TSW, uncomment the following lines and manually assign them here:
# $hWnd = 0x0
# $pID = 0

# The following lines modifies the hotkey to be Winkey+F2
MODIFIER = 8
KEY = 113
# Other examples:
# MODIFIER = 6; KEY = 90 # Ctrl+Shift+Z
# MODIFIER = 0; KEY = 9 # Tab. This is dangerous and deprecated
# And so on.
# Cheat sheet: 0=None, 1=Alt, 2=Ctrl, 4=Shift, 8=Win.
# Virtual key codes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes. A-Z is just their ASCII (65-90). F1-F12 is 112-123.
